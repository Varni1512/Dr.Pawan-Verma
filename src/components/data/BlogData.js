            "summary" : "For all the uninitiated and the under-privileged who have been deprived of the fun of working in a Life insurance company, I would like to present a few glimpses of the same for their benefit. Have you ever imagined what a Life insurance company looks like? Let me suggest that you may visualize a typical Life insurance company as a bus transporting passengers to their respective destinations. There is this Sales Director who, immediately after sighting the bus, jumps into it, grabs the steering wheel and starts pressing the accelerator, while the Chief Underwriter keeps on pressing her foot constantly on the brake and the Compliance Head keeps on honking incessantly. While all this is happening, the Appointed Actuary keeps continuously looking into the rear view mirror and giving directions how to move forward."

However, he does not bother to stop the bus even if some passengers fall down from the moving bus accidentally unless they have paid the fare, i.e. the premium."

In fact, the only thin line of difference between God and an actuary is that God never thinks that He is an actuary. The actuaries are in fact, bright individuals who are professionally fond of handling figures – but of the excel sheet variety only. Their interests in vital statistics also remain limited to those relating to the insurance companies only. In fact, the literature on actuarial science provides some interesting role models one of which relates to a tall, young and handsome actuary who had two beautiful wives living separately from each other. As the story goes, the young actuary would often lie to them, telling each of them that he was with the other, and thus finding out time to go to office to do some actuarial modelling. ",

They are the ones who, with their analysis of the past trends and future projections, tell a Life insurance company in advance how many of its customers are going to die in a particular year. But, before you misunderstand it, let me clarify that they are different from the mafia, as the mafia goes a step further and decides who are the ones that are going to die! The actuaries are also different from the mafia in the sense that you can negotiate with the mafia and get some concessions from them.",

Their job is to keep a constant watch on the financial health of the insurance companies. However, as a result of the constantly falling top lines and rising expense lines year after year, most of these Appointed Actuaries have turned into disappointed actuaries today.",

They work on the theory of probability and by analyzing the historical data and trends; predict the probability of the occurrence of similar trends in future as well. As students of the actuarial science, the actuaries would have an absolute belief in the theory of probability and they would not allow any unknown factors, emerging trends or unexplained possibilities to impact their judgment. You must have heard the story of the old and veteran actuary who had a sudden chest pain while walking down the staircase. Suspecting it to be a heart attack, he immediately jumped down the staircase after doing a quick calculation that as per past data, the probability of a person having a heart attack while falling down from a staircase was much less than the probability of a person having a heart attack while climbing down the staircase. The rest is part of the sad history as the actuarial books have recorded the incident as one of the rare exceptions when the theory did not work.",

And they are never reluctant to showcase their skills. It happened once that an actuary was travelling in a train with a farmer. True to his nature, the actuary was boasting of his mental faculties trying to impress the farmer. As the train passed a flock of sheep in a meadow, the farmer asked, “Can you count the sheep in the flock and tell me?” The actuary looked at the flock and said with a winning smile, 'There are 1,159 sheep out there.' The farmer was impressed as he said, 'Incredible! By chance, I happen to be the owner of the flock and I know that they are exactly 1,159. But how did you count them so quickly?' The actuary answered, 'Easy, I just counted the number of legs and divided it by four.”",

And that becomes possibly the only weakness that they possess as a tribe. A friend of mine told me the story of a young actuary who had come to seek admission to an advanced actuarial course. As the queue was long, the clerk told him to go to the end of the line. The young man came back five minutes later and said he couldn't because someone else was already there.",

Quite often they get cheated by small-time street vendors and shop keepers because these votaries of higher maths tend to forget the lower maths involving addition, subtraction, etc. I was myself witness to a scene when I once walked into the actuarial department of my office. What I saw was simply mind-boggling. There were three young actuarial interns, busily involved with something in the centre of the room. As I went closer, I saw one of them was holding a long board upright, the second was steadying a chair on a desk while the third intern was standing on the chair placed on the desk. He had one end of a tape measure and the first student had the other. Amused, I enquired what they were doing. They answered in a chorus, 'We're trying to measure this board.' Perplexed, I said, 'Why don’t you lay it down on the floor and measure it?' They said, 'We have already measured its length, now we are measuring its height.'",

While it is extremely difficult for a salesman to say “no”, an actuary would find it almost impossible to say “yes” to any proposal.

    //   title: "The Reincarnation Time",
    //   summary:
    //     "The only time I believe in reincarnation is at 5.00 o'clock in the evenings, when all the dead people in my office come back to life. It is an everyday experience that when they come to work in the morning, the body enters the building, but the soul stays away. The body, thus lifeless during the day, joins the soul only in the evening, and hence the rejoicing at the reincarnation.After the day-long separation, the eagerness of the body to meet the soul waiting outside, has to be seen to be believed. Although an avid watcher of the body and soul union scenes for the last 15 years, I could appreciate the intensity of the jubiliation only last month, when there was a practice fire drill in my office. On ringing the fire alarm bell, the 210 employees evacuated the two-storey building in three minutes and 15 seconds. But the same evening, when time was clocked, the building was cleared in exactly two minutes.",
